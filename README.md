# d3-grouped-bar-chart-drownings-ajc
Two reponsive bar charts built with D3 for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The stacked bar chart represents pool drownings and non-pool drownings as recorded by the state of Georgia's death certificates from 2010 to 2016. The second chart represents the number of drownings reported by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources versus the number found by the AJC in an analysis of death certificates.</br>
